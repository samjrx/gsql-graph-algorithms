  description: Community detection algorithms assign vertices to clusters based on shared characteristics or comparatively high 'intra-community' density-- i.e. identify groups of vertices that are very highly connected to one another. There are many approaches to this problem, but many examples, like Louvain Modularity, make iterative clustering decisions (merge vertex A to community B) based on the projected delta to some clustering index. A clustering index refers to some equation or metric that expresses the 'quality' of the currently identified communities. So, the decision process looks something like, a) calculate current clustering index, b) for each vertex, consider the delta to the clustering index were the vertex to join the community of an adjacent vertex, c) repeat until the clustering index converges to some local (or potentially global) optimum.
