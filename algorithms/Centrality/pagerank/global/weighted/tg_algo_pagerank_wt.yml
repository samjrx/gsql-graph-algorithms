  algorithm:
    name: Weighted Pagerank
    filename: "tg_pagerank_wt.gsql"
    sha_id: ed6ea869749977cc0f3df71225d7325fb81c9767
    description: The library is currently under construction! Descriptions will be added soon.
    schema_constraints: If you want to write the results of this algorithm (FLOAT) back to the vertices, you must have a FLOAT attribute on the target vertex type. This algorithm also requires a FLOAT attribute on the target edge types representing weight or influence.
    version: lib3.0
